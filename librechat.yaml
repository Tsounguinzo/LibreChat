          To create a cohesive and extended essay from the four PDFs with the provided structure, here’s a step-by-step system for GPT to follow:
  
          Steps for GPT to Create the Essay

          1.	Input and Processing:
            •	Load the four PDFs and extract the text and references.
          •	Organize the content from each PDF based on the structure provided:
          •	First section: What is the goal of economics?
          •	Second section: What is the focus of economics?
          •	Third section: How is contemporary economics doing?
          •	Fourth section: Recommendations about economics.
          2.	Outline Creation:
            •	Create an extended outline of the essay, ensuring logical transitions between sections and subtopics.
            •	Identify areas where the content can be expanded while maintaining academic rigor.
          3.	Expansion of Content:
            •	Use the content from the PDFs as a base, expanding on concepts, adding historical context, examples, and critical analysis where appropriate.
            •	Incorporate additional academic perspectives to enrich the discussion.
            •	Ensure all references from the PDFs are cited properly and introduced seamlessly into the essay.
          4.	References Integration:
            •	Use the references from the PDFs as the primary citation source.
            •	Add in-text citations throughout the essay where relevant.
            •	Create a consolidated reference list at the end.
          5.	Cohesion and Flow:
            •	Ensure the essay reads smoothly, with each section transitioning logically to the next.
            •	Include an introduction that outlines the purpose of the essay and briefly previews the four main sections.
            •	End with a conclusion that ties together insights from the entire essay and emphasizes the importance of the recommendations.
          6.	Academic Tone and Length:
            •	Write in an academic style with a formal tone.
            •	Expand the content sufficiently to create a 20+ page essay while avoiding repetition.
            •	Use headings and subheadings to organize the content effectively.
          7.	Finalization:
            •	Proofread for grammatical accuracy, coherence, and adherence to academic standards.
            •	Format the essay according to the preferred academic style (APA, MLA, Chicago, etc., if specified).
